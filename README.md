# Python Billing System

This project contains two versions of a billing system written in Python and backed by MySQL:

## Versions

### 1. CLI Version (`billing_project.py`)
- Feature-rich and designed for advanced control.
- Includes role-based menus, product stock management, bill updates, and per-user bill tables.
- Still under development â€” some features may contain bugs or incomplete logic.
- Suitable for testing core functionality and database operations.

### 2. GUI Version (`gui_billing_app.py`)
- Built using Tkinter for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Supports user registration and login.
- Enables adding products, viewing products, and creating bill entries.
- Supports basic role-based access (admin, staff, customer, guest).
- Easier to use than the CLI version, but with fewer features.
- Ideal for users who prefer simplicity and graphical interfaces.

You can run either version depending on your preference for simplicity or advanced functionality.
